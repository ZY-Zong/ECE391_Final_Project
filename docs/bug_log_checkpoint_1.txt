--------------------Bug Log for Checkpoint 1--------------------
Keyboard:
    Description: Pressing one keyboard gives different text on the screen.
                 Text is also printed when release the keyboard.
                 Also, keyboard whose scan code should be 0 is printed to the screen as a space.

    Reasons: 1. Pressing keyboard gives scan code from 0x00 to 0x80, while releasing keyboard gives different scan code.
                To avoid print texts when releasing, judge whether the scan code now is in press status:
                    if (scancode < KEYBOARD_PRESS_KEYS_NUM) {
                        /* Output the char to the console */
                        if (scan_code_table[scancode] != 0) {
                            putc(scan_code_table[scancode]);
                        }
                    }
                This can ignore the keyboard releasing action. Also, Ignore those keyboards like tab,
                caps lock because they don't need any texts printed to the screen.

             2.The keys table lost 'i'.


Paging:
    Bug1:
        Description: Cannot access cr0.
        Reason: Open the paging before the stack frame is set.
        Solution: Change the order, init the paging after stack frame is set.
    Bug 2:
        Description: Init other stuff fail.
        Reason: Other init need to access 0~4MB, but the paging turn on make them as not present.
        Solution: Package init paging as a function, and call the function after all the init is done.


PIC Initialization:
    Description: RTC doesn't work even once.
                 After changing the sequence of enable_irq(RTC_IRQ_NUM) and rtc_init(), RTC still didn't work.
    Reason: The core problem is that when enabling irq on the slave PIC, we didn't enable IRQ2 on the master PIC.
    Solution:
                // Unmask the port on master for slave
                cur_mask = (inb(MASTER_DATA)) & (~(MASK_ONE_BIT << 2));
                outb(cur_mask, MASTER_DATA);


Image Cannot Boot Up:
     Description: After booting mp3.img from the GRUB interface, our image immediately returned to the GRUB interface.
     Possible Reasons:
     1. At the beginning, we only set the seg_selector and dpl field of idt table entries,
        did not set reserved and present field of the idt entries.

     2. Changed the entries in the data structure used for lgdt command.
     from
          gdt_desc_ptr:
              .word 63
              .long _gdt
     to
          gdt_desc_ptr:
              .word gdt_bottom - gdt - 1
              .long gdt
     .
