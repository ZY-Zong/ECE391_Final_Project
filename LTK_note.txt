    start MP3
    try to be familiar with git branch
    try to merge
    begin mp3.1
    Load the GDT
        the GDT discription is in IA32 doc 3.5.1 (p 838) 
        .quad is for a space of 64 bits value
        realized that I just need to translate the CS into GDT 
        OK...the GDT is already povoded
        maybe the thing I need to do is to initialize all these in boot.S

    deal with paging 
        basic idea: translate linear address into physical address 
        CR3(PDBR) holds the base of PD, which is changed when new program is executed
        the doc says set the mapping according to the order of the program 
        need to do:
            initialize the paging (kernel) when OS boot 
            set a new page when new program run
        3.6.1 paging option: (the ones needed)
            paging flag: bit 31 of CR0 
            page size extension flag: bit 4 of CR4
        in cp1, I only need to 
            set first 0-4MB into 4kb pages 
                map VRAM corrected, and set others as not present
            set 4MB-4GB into 4MB pages 
                map virtual memory 4-8MB to physical memory 4-8MB 
                set others as not present 
        just use one page directory and one mode 
        but set the PS bit in the PDE for a 4MB page 
        figuring out where ot store PD and PT 
            maybe in x86_desc.S 
            align to 4kB?
