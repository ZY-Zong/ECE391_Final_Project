--------------------Bug Log for Checkpoint 2--------------------
RTC:
    Description: RTC cannot go out of while loop, RTC cannot be set to 2 Hz.
    Reason: 1. Did nothing in while loop, so flag is always 0. Should update the flag rtc_interrupt_occured
            in while loop.

            2. The frequency is changed in the rtc interrupt handler, but not the write function, so it will not
            be set immediately. Should modify the frequency in the rtc_write function.

            3. Add rtc_restart_interrupt in rtc_read, because it needs to take another interrupt to
            make interrupt available 0.5s after rtc_read. Or the interrupt may happen at a random
            time.

    Description: Setting works now. Test with thirty interrupts, and frequencies with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 Hz.
                 Tests finish immediately, something must be wrong.
    Reason: Flag rtc_interrupt_occured should be given to local variable before entering the while loop,
            or it will never goes inside the loop:

                cli();
                flag_t = rtc_interrupt_occured;
                sti();
                while (!flag_t) {...}

            or use do while:

                do {
                    // Update flag_t;
                } while (!flag_t);


Exception after system call:
    Description: After int 0x80, we have exception 11 (segment not present).

    Reason: Did not set present field of system call in the IDT.
